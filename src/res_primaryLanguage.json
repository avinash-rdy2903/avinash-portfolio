          "abstract":"Agriculture plays a chiefly role in economy as well as it is considered to be the backbone of economic system for developing countries. For decades, agriculture has been related with the production of vital food crops. Paddy rice is a staple crop for much of the worlds population. It is also a key source of the greenhouse gas methane, responsible for about 40 million tonnes, or 10% of global emissions, each year. Thus, the proposed research work aims to predict the type of disease in a paddy plant to help the farmer in deciding the fertilizer that shall be given to the plant for its healthy growth. Here the trending deep learning technology is used to achieve the proposed solution. An innovative modified VGGNet architecture is proposed which uses two different types of optimization technique to increase the accuracy is used for training the dataset. Then the trained model that is generated by this algorithm is given as an input to the next algorithm where resnet is used to further increase the accuracy of the model. The datasets were collected from UCI real time images as well as the GitHub datasets and the training are performed. The three different types of paddy disease such as bacterial leaf blight, blast, brown spot is used for prediction. The three different types of datasets used were UCI repository, Github images as well as images searched from internet. The experimental results of three diseases show that 97% of accuracy is achieved in predicting the type of disease in paddy plant.",
